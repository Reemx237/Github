 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.

var schooling = 3
print(schooling)
//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling=4
print(schooling)
//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("Yes it does because I use the keyword var so it will be a variable (i.e can  be updatable)")

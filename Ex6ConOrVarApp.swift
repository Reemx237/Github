/*
## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

print("The name of the person cannot change in normal situation")
var age=22
print("It's natural for humans getting old so it will change periodically")
var currentStep=2500
print("At the moment it will be constant but I choose var because it could change  after 1 hour or even minute")
let goalSteps=3000
print("In my view normally the goal is the minimum number of steps I have to do in a day so it will be a fixed goal")
var avarageHearRate=90
print("At the moment it will be constant but I choose var because it could change  after 1 hour or even minute")

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
